# TeXRay
Ray tracing experiments done at TACC/University of Texas. This repo contains experiments in ray tracing for scientific visualization that I did
while at the University of Texas. I set this up to do experimental things before I folded them into "production" code that came out of my
group (Scalable Visualization Technologies). 
## Utilities
The repo contains utility code that is not specifically related to ray tracing but comes in handy. In particular every ray tracing code uses
some sort of vector class with accompanying matrix multiplication (transform) class. This code is generic and can be used for many other
graphics purposes. I could use the glm code for this and I will support that option but I like to reduce the amount of thirdparty 
depennds.
