    "# Ray Tracing Experiments\n",
    "Notebook full of ray tracing experiments in python. Using numpy as a basic datastructure, experiment with basic techniques for ray tracing images. Play with data structures, multiprocessing, ray intersection algorithms, shading, anything goes. \n",
    "## Images\n",
    "We are going to need an image. An image is a rectangular array of triples (RGB) values. The PythonImageTest notebook contains experiments with images in python and how to store and display them. In that notebook it was determined that we can store RGB values in numpy arrays and manipulate them using the PIL library if we want to and/or display them using matplotlib. The thing to remember about images is that the pixel order is top to bottom and left to right. The pixels are arranged in row order, just like a c array. Images have the origin in the top left corner. Pixel (0,0) is at the top left. By convention screen coordinate origin is at the lower left. This is flipped vertically from image order. You have to keep an eye on this order (get it,,, eye) or your images will be upside down. All of this is handled in the logic of the renderer and the camera and image objects. \n"
